# What is Open IPA?
Open IPA is a free, fast, community-focused transcription tool to transcribe texts in Latin, French, German, and Italian into IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet). OpenIPA transcribes text in real-time, and provides in-depth transcription feedback for each letter or group of letters transcribed. Open IPA is meant primarily for Lyric Diction and to aid in song preparation for classical voice.

# Getting Started
Getting started with Open IPA is easy. Simply head on over to www.openipa.org, pick the language your text is in, and type or paste it in the field provided. Open IPA will transcribe the text for you, which you are free to copy or export to a PDF using the buttons at the bottom of the editor. If you would like to know more about how your text was transcribed, simply hover over the outputted text (original or IPA) to see an in-depth analysis of how each letter, syllable, and word was transcribed.

# Requirements
All you need to use Open IPA is a web browser and a song to transcribe!

# FAQ
### How accurate is Open IPA?
While we strive to have our transcription algorithm be as accurate as possible, there are bound to be errors eventually. We are actively working to improve our database of exceptions, but some exception words may not be included at this time. In addition, certain transcription rules that revolve around more than just the letters themselves (e.g. part of speech) are still a work in progress. If your transcription does not seem correct, we encourage you to use the transcription feedback you get from Open IPA to your advantage â€“ it can help determine where the issue may lie, and help you to track down the correct transcription.

### How can I get involved?
As Open IPA is open-source, contributions are welcome. In addition, if you have any comments, questions, or feedback you are welcome to join us over at [r/openipa](https://www.reddit.com/r/openipa/). We hope to see you there!
